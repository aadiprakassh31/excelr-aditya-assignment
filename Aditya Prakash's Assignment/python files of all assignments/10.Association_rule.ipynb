It helps determine how much more likely two items (or itemsets) are to be bought together compared to being bought independently. It is defined as:\n","\n","$$\n","\\text{Lift} = \\frac{\\text{Confidence of the rule}}{\\text{Expected confidence if the items were independent}}\n","$$\n","\n","**Importance of Lift**:\n","- A lift value greater than 1 indicates that the occurrence of the antecedent increases the likelihood of the occurrence of the consequent, which signifies a positive association.\n","- A lift value of less than 1 implies that the antecedent reduces the likelihood of the consequent, indicating a negative association.\n","- A lift value equal to 1 suggests no association between the two itemsets.\n","\n","Lift is crucial in **market basket analysis** because it helps retailers understand the strength of associations and can be used to identify items that should be promoted together. For example, if `milk` and `bread` have a lift of 2, it means customers are twice as likely to buy bread when they buy milk compared to what would happen by chance.\n","\n","### 2. **What is support and confidence? How do you calculate them?**\n","\n","**Support** and **confidence** are key metrics in association rule mining.\n","\n","- **Support**:\n","  Support is the proportion of transactions in the dataset that contain a specific itemset. It indicates how frequently an item or itemset appears in the data.\n","\n","$$\n","\\text{Support (A)} = \\frac{\\text{Number of transactions containing A}}{\\text{Total number of transactions}}\n"," $$\n","\n","  For example, if `milk` appears in 30 out of 100 transactions, its support is 0.3.\n","\n","- **Confidence**:\n","  Confidence measures how often items in the consequent appear in transactions that also contain the antecedent. It is the conditional probability of the consequent given the antecedent.\n","\n","$$\n","\\text{Confidence (A \\rightarrow B)} = \\frac{\\text{Support (A \\cap B)}}{\\text{Support (A)}}\n","$$\n","\n","  For example, if 30 out of 50 transactions containing `milk` also contain `bread`, the confidence of the rule `milk → bread` is 0.6 (or 60%).\n","\n","### 3. **What are some limitations or challenges of Association rules mining?**\n","\n","**Limitations or Challenges** of Association Rule Mining:\n","\n","1. **Computational Complexity**:\n","   - As the dataset grows, the number of possible item combinations increases exponentially. This makes association rule mining computationally expensive for large datasets, especially if the minimum support threshold is set low.\n","\n","2. **Selection of Thresholds**:\n","   - The results depend heavily on the selection of minimum support, confidence, and lift thresholds. If the thresholds are set too high, interesting rules may be missed. If set too low, too many trivial or irrelevant rules might be generated.\n","\n","3. **Overfitting to Noise**:\n","   - Association rule mining can sometimes generate rules based on noise or random co-occurrences in the data, leading to misleading conclusions.\n","\n","4. **Interpretability**:\n","   - When many rules are generated, especially in large datasets, it becomes difficult to interpret which rules are truly meaningful and actionable.\n","\n","5. **Sparsity of Data**:\n","   - In many real-world datasets (e.g., market basket data), most transactions contain only a small subset of all available items. This can result in a large number of itemsets having very low support, making it challenging to identify frequent patterns.\n","\n","6. **Lack of Temporal Considerations**:\n","   - Association rule mining does not take into account the timing of purchases or events. In reality, some associations may only hold for a specific time period or under certain conditions, but traditional rule mining doesn’t capture these dynamics.\n","\n","Addressing these challenges often involves adjusting thresholds, using pruning techniques, or applying more advanced algorithms like FP-Growth for large datasets.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"InH9h2RllVR7"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"kTMI-8SPlRlL"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
